In November 2012, villagers opposition to the project resulted in 4 people wounded, including 2 soldiers, and 15 arrests. Witness testimonies claim that the villagers came to find the company working their lands. In August 2012 the inhabitants of Ndiael, an area of 26 000 hectares, which comprises numerous villages, cemeteries and mosques, demonstrated clear opposition to the project and vowed to fight back. Prior to this, the investors tried to implement the project in Fanaye, St Louis, where violent protests and opposition to the project left 2 people dead and around 20 wounded in October 2011. According to Greenpeace, an estimated 650 000 hectares of land, 17% of Senegals arable land, have been sold or given away to private companies. The previous government of Abdoulaye Wade aimed to develop biofuels as an alternative to imported fuel. In July 2012, President Macky Sall said he was willing to re-examine a new proposal by the Senegalese-Italian company Sen-Ethanol if it conformed to the interests of the country. Women are specially impacted by the arrival of Senhuile on their lands. They have more difficulties to raise their livestocks as well as they do not benefit from paid farm work, while men do. Their situation is all the more precarious  because they are not owners of the land they cultivate. Women are trying to acquire legal ownership to better protect their land and means of livelihood. Smart phones app encoders have developed an app to ease women's possibilities to buy land. That solution is limited to those who have the monetary means since land remains expensive. "

SIFCA was given a 25-year lease on the lands after the 25-year lease from Decoris expired. Simultaneously, SIFCA signed an agreement with the government to expand its rubber plantations from 8,000 ha to 35,000 ha in Maryland and River Gee counties (formerly operated by Firestone). The management of the plantations is plagued with allegations of employment fraud, including hiring illegal aliens and 'gross and consistent abuse of Liberian workers', and violating the Liberian Labor Laws. Over fifteen hundred protesters peacefully marched and demonstrated for a week in February of 2013 against employment practices of the company, including pay disparity, lack of social services, rendering workers homeless, and dismissal of pregnant employees. The demonstrations followed futile engagements between the company and their employees, and cumulated in four arrests. Previous protests (2011) left many arrested and one dead, with no satisfactory outcome. SIFCA is partly owned by Wilmar and Olam of Singapore. "

It planned to sell biodiesel to the European Union market on the back of an EU Renewable Energy Directive that set a 10 per cent binding target for use of renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020. Huge tracts of land were cleared, much of it ecologically sensitive woodland. But one of the main investors in BioShape, Eneco Energie BV, pulled out in early 2009. In November 2009, the company ceased operations[2]. Areas of dispute stretch back to the beginning of the project, with allegations of irregularities in the Environmental Impact Assessment. Other concerns were around food security, because people left farming to work for Bioshape, where there were complaints of long working hours and poor pay. There were also concerns about the level of compensation paid for land as payments did not meet expectations. Furthermore, there were allegations that Bioshape was more interested in the land for its timber value as timber from forests cleared was exported. "
-6.445,38.891,"Bagamoyo, Tanzania",Agrofuels and Biomass Energy Plants,"In 2006 the Swedish company SEKAB signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Tanzania to cultivate 20,000 hectares of sugar cane for the European biofuel market. The area targeted by the company is located 20 km from Bagamoyo town and it was given in 1974 to the Government of Zanzibar by Tanzania’s first President for livestock production. The ranch was then closed in 1994 and the land returned under the control of the Tanzanian government. Since then the latter considered the area uninhabited and unused, despite many people have been living there in dependence on forest resources. In 2007 SEKAB chose ORGUT, a Swedish consultancy firm, to conduct the Environmental and Social Impact Analysis (ESIA). ORGUT’s ESIA found out that more than 1000 people were living within the project’s area and showed some critical issues such as a huge water requirement, the possible loss of biodiversity and common resources, including the wildlife in the nearby Saadani National Park, rising conflicts between communities, the increase of communicable diseases, as HIV and malaria, due to the influx of workers and the growing of social interactions. Despite these risks, SEKAB altered ORGUT’s conclusions and submitted a revisited and softened version of ESIA to the National Environmental Management Council, which was approved in 2008. Before starting any operations, SEKAB in 2009 sold the project to the Swedish company AgroEcoEnergy as a consequence of the international crisis and lack of funds. The new company revisited the project by planning the production of sugar cane for the local market and the production of ethanol for the generation and supply of electricity. The African Development Bank Group accepted to provide secure funding for this project on the condition that the ADBG’s Involuntary Resettlement Policy and the International Financial Corporation’s Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability were complied by AgroEcoEnergy. Both standards encourage investors to avoid resettlement whenever possible or to minimized negative impacts if resettlement is unavoidable. The company mandated in 2010 International Development Consultants Limited to carry out the first Resettlement Action Plan in accordance with funders’ standards. The RAP identified 1374 people to be affected by the project and eligible for compensation. Since the Government didn’t recognize people’s land rights, the company would have had to cover the full cost of compensation and resettlement, causing the slowing down of the project. After a year of negotiation, the Government decided to act as if the land was legally occupied and, according the Land Laws of 1999, recognized 815 people eligible for compensations. This census didn’t include all those impacted by project like Barbaig pastoralists or the illegal charcoal makers. Moreover, the Land Laws only provide monetary compensation and fail to comply with the funders’ standards. For this reason, the company was supposed to bear the costs of providing new houses and land for those living in the area. In 2013 Ecoenergy acquired a derivative right of occupancy for 99-years, but in June 2016 Tanzanian government took the decision to halt the project. Action Aid considered this a ""victory"" for vulnerable local communities and for the surrounding wildlife.  As reported some months earlier in The Guardian (21 October 2015), Per Carstedt, executive chairman of the Swedish company Agro EcoEnergy, had a dream for  land on the north Tanzanian coast,  a dream quite similater to that proposed for the Tana Delta in Kenya by other investors. Under his firm’s plan, farmers who once depended on subsistence work would earn wages on a sugarcane plantation or from selling sugarcane they grow to a sugar mill. The factory wouldl process sugar for export as well as for ethanol. The fields would be crisscrossed with irrigation canals and treated with a mix of organic and synthetic fertiliser. Within a few years, Tanzania would be the biggest sugar producer in theEast African Community. Carstedt was adamant that large-scale farming projects are central to meeting Africa’s rising food needs. “What can a smallholder do if he doesn’t have access to infrastructure, access to market, access to training? Well, he does what he’s done for generations – produce the food he needs to survive,” Carstedt said, speaking to The Guardian in his office halfway between the project area of Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam.  However, the shelving of the project in 2016 had been foreseen in the financial press. Thus The Economist Intelligence Unit had reported on 2 June 2015 that the proposed US$620m sugar project in Bagamoyo (some 75 km north of Dar es Salaam) faced an uncertain future, following the decision by a number of key backers to withdraw their financial commitments.              "
-4.031,5.368,"Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire",E-waste and other waste import zones,"On August 20, 2006, toxic waste was illegally exported from Europe by multinational trading company Trafigura and left in Akoudo, a dump site in the middle of a poor residential area of Abidjan, and in 18 other sites in the city. Tens of thousands of people suffered severe health effects and 15 to 17 people died. The waste was produced from unrefined gasoline by a process called caustic washing, a process banned by most countries. Ivorians staged protests and demonstrations in the city following the dumping. In Ivory Coast, the company paid the Ivorian government USD 195 million in settlement and became immune from prosecution. In 2010/11 a Dutch court found Trafigura guilty of the illegal export of waste from the Netherlands to Africa and for concealing the harmful nature of the waste for life and health. However, an out of court settlement requiring Trafigura to pay total 1.3 million euros ($1.7 million) in fines concluded the legal process in the Netherlands. No studies have been undertaken to assess the long-term health impacts of the waste and the exact composition of the waste has not been made public. Thousands of Ivorians are yet to receive compensation"

A report by the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency says that the waste contains many toxic chemicals, neurotoxins, and carcinogens. E-waste recyclers can develop respiratory illness, developmental and behavioral disorders, damaged immune, nervous and blood systems, kidney damage, impaired brain development, mental disability from lead poisoning, and eventually cancer. Acute or chronic exposure to toxic e-waste can be fatal. The environmental impacts are also disastrous with toxic metals flowing into the land and the nearby river, which has died.

The mill takes fresh water from the Mkhomazi river and uses energy derived from dirty coal to convert wood fibre from mostly alien Eucalyptus tree plantations into cellulose for export markets. However it also generates much atmospheric pollution which spreads into surrounding community areas. Liquid effluent is pumped out to sea, and solid waste in the form of ash and sludge is dumped onto farmland in the vicinity of the mill. Over the years there have been incidents of poisoning of workers and children due to the accidental release of toxic gases. People in surrounding communities complain of illness due to the polluted air and dust they are exposed to on a daily basis. Unfortunately Sappi Saiccor has chosen to continue expanding its production capacity despite numerous promises that it would clean up its act. Sappi Saiccor is at present (May 2012) trying to obtain an integrated waste management permit that if granted will likely rubberstamp its existing waste dumping and pollution of air and water. "
5.5546,-0.2267,"Agbogbloshie (Accra), Ghana","Landfills, toxic waste treatment, uncontrolled dump sites","Agbogbloshie is a slum in the heart of Accra, Ghana, that has achieved notoriety as one of the most polluted slums in the world by hosting one of the largest electronic waste dump in Africa. In this area the poorest classes of Accra have been spending years dismantling, recovering, weighing and reselling parts and metals extracted from the scrapped devices and from the heaps of electronic waste. [1] [3] [4]. The majority of the e-waste that ends up in Agbogbloshie first enters the African continent through South Africa via Durban, Tunisia via Bizerte, and Nigeria via Lagos, so shipments containing hazardous materials circumvent the Basel and Bamako Conventions due to wording and labelling tactics. Once in Ghana, a shipment will more likely reach an informal facility in Accra where end-of-life electronic goods, including high scrap-value goods like automobiles, will pile up in one of several locations in the city, like Agbogbloshie. Every day informal workers transform used electronic products into working units and extract heavy and precious metals (often by burning electric cables) for reuse in secondhand formal and informal markets. The e-waste that has been either refurbished/repaired or recycled will later arrive in the hands of a middleman. These e-waste intermediaries may be scrap collectors who have ascended within the industry due to their connections in Accra and with international players and/or their monetary power. Many scrap dealers are connected to international scrap firms that are located in the Tema Export Processing Zone. These entities send Ghanaian recovered copper, mixed scraps and other metals to international recycling firms in Europe, China, India, and the Middle East. These international players have greater technical capabilities and accumulate scraps from numerous e-waste hubs, thereby achieving economies of scale in recycling. At the same time, some streams of refurbished and repaired consumer goods, as well as extracted metals, re-enter the Ghanaian domestic market, where firms in Ghana secure locally processed copper and aluminum fractions from scrap dealers. The non-valuable fractions and the unusable/irreparable e-waste components either end up in a formal landfill or in an informal dumping ground to be burned [3] [7] [6] [2]. All these rudimentary recycling techniques practiced by informal e-waste processers, on the one hand, exacerbate the release of environmental toxins that pollute and contaminate landscapes, waters, and biota of Agbogbloshie. Waste left in fields and nearby bodies of water is ingested by animals and marine life, thus creating entry points for toxins into non-human ecological systems, while indirectly affecting humans via consumption of fish and seafood that are dietary staples for coastal residents of Ghana, increasing their risk of cancer. On the other hand, little-to-no protective measures in use, endanger not only the e-waste workers, but also local inhabitants, particularly children and infants. Due to the pervasive nature of environmental toxins in the local atmosphere, residents of the nearby settlement of Old Fadama and those working and residing in the central business district (CBD) are at risk of experiencing high exposure levels on a daily basis. Air samples from the Agbogbloshie Market have revealed heavy metals and polychlorinated naphthalene (PCN) congeners. Blood samples of e-waste workers have been shown to exhibit elevated concentrations of heavy metals and flame retardants. Indeed, heavy metals and chemical compounds found within electronic devices have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and/or fetal perturbations [3] [7]. Negative human and environmental impacts, that are a result of informal recycling, are a direct consequence of the lack of Ghanaian government intervention. Ghana’s authorities have proposed the demolition of Agbogbloshie several times, and early operations in this direction have began in June 2015. But the approach taken is raising concerns because, according to locals organizations, this doesn’t solve the problem, it simply moves it elsewhere. The situation is even more complicated since, in absence of decent work in Accra, the Agbogbloshie site alone provides livelihood opportunities and quick cash business to approximately 4500–6000 workers and perhaps another 1500 indirectly [1] [3]. The German government announced in March 2017 a 20 million euro ($21.5 million) project it says will transform the electronic waste processing system in Accra. It calls for the building of an e-waste recycling facility where materials can be brought and sold and processed safely to the benefit of the local community [4]"
6.601,3.3504,"Ikeja, Nigeria","Landfills, toxic waste treatment, uncontrolled dump sites","The general flow of e-waste in Nigeria starts with the importers who in most cases double as brokers. They work closely with the Lagos sea port authorities. The importers operate under the umbrella of Computer and Allied Product Dealer Association of Nigeria (CAPDAN) a regulatory body in charge of coordinating affairs in the IT industry. Importers purchase containers by its weight and not by the value of what is inside them. Medium/high quality gadgets are taken for repair/refurbishing and then are sold, usually, in the Ikeja Computer village or Alaba International market. Those considered scraps or junk are taken to different land-fills spread around the city [5] [2] [3]. The Lagos state Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) delivers the collected waste to three official dumpsites in Lagos Olusosun dumpsite, Igodun and Ikorodu. In there, several thousands of non-registered individuals, including children, widely referred to as “scavengers”, work to collect and recycle e-waste. In few cases, waste picker communities or waste scavengers living on or next to the dump sites sort valuable e-waste and sell the recovered metals such as steel, aluminum and copper dealing directly with end-processing units (such as industries who re-melt and refineries). However, the common practice among recyclers is to sell extracted materials to middle-men who take them to end processing units. Many recyclers are also active in the collection of other kind of waste. [8] [5] [7]. The e-waste sector impacts positively economically on the nearby communities and e-waste still proves to be a favorable alternative source of income. The number of jobs provided by the e-waste sector both formal and informal is substantial considering the level of unemployment. The availability of a market such as national consumption as well as export to neighboring countries for the refurbished electronic devices and the extracted materials from informal recycling ensures that this trade will continue [8] [9]. Besides the obvious resources employed in the manufacturing process of electronic devices, improper and indiscriminate disposing and recycling of e-waste has some serious health, environmental and legal implications [8]. The most affected communities are those in the environ of the Alaba International market, Ikeja Computer Village, Odo iya Alaro and Olushosun dump sites with area of influence of pollution spreading to the Ojota, Ikeja and Alaba axis. On the one hand, unusable e–waste is carelessly dumped around these communities and occasionally burnt to reduce growing piles or to the recovery of copper. The burning activities release highly toxic fumes and the dismantling and breaking operations contaminate with heavy metals the soil and nearby water bodies used for domestic purposes and farmlands. On the other hand, the high concentration of electronic waste in a location could generate “accumulated radiation”. Consequently, the sector poses serious health and environmental risk for both the workers and the immediate and neighbouring communities. These toxic metals could lead to health problems such as blood poisoning, breakdown of central nervous system, rising cases of cancer, kidney problems as well as vital organ failures, especially in children. The pickers are often unaware of the dangers they face but are economically tied to continuing the occupation [9] [1] [2]. "

Addax Petroleum, which is a subsidiary of the Sinopec Group, one of the largest oil and gas producers in China and the third largest worldwide oil refiner, has been present in Gabon since 2004.Together with its subcontractors, the company has been exploiting a concession near the Mandji Isle, department of Ndolou in the Ngounié province. In 2010 it was revealed, that the company had been discharging toxic chemical waste into an artificial lake which then feeds directly into the river Obangué. The river is the principal source of freshwater for local inhabitants of the area. A local official from Fouanou, an oil town which is situated a hundred kilometers from Mandji Isle, has testified that local inhabitants have been highly exposed to numerous sicknesses, as they consume the Obangué river's water as well as the fish. Equally, crops as well as animals have been reportedly affected by the pollution caused by Addax. After complaints were made by local authorities, Addax first installed a few public fountains, but did not maintain them when they broke down, leaving villagers with no other option than to continue consuming the polluted river water. According to Marc Ona Essangui, 2009 Goldman Prize recipient, of the local NGO Brainforest, pollution has been going on for almost a decade. Other than pollution coming directly from the oil, there have been reported other sources of pollution such as from sewerage from camp kitchens and toilets that have been dumped in the river, as well as a pipeline leak that took place on December 7, 2009 and gas flaring around the same time. In 2010, after missions to the sites and reports in the newspaper by WWF and local NGOs, the Government of Gabon found Addax Petroleum responsible for polluting the Obangué River, which was considered a great success in the local media, although the affected population has not received any compensation until this day.From 2013 to 2014, Gabon and Addax Petroleum engaged in a legal battle on licence and breaches of contract issues not directly related to the pollution. After having transferred the Obangue Oilfield to to Gabon Oil Company because of failure to pay taxes, Addax was ""seeking $330 million dollars in damages from Gabon at the ICC International Court of Arbitration and Gabon responded with a lcaim of $780 million"". It resulted in Addax paying $400 million to Gabon to end the oil conflict and continue its presence in the region."

10.6668,-14.597,"Kamsar, Guinea",Tailings From Mines,"The CMB-WPA consortium (Compagnie Minière Boké-Winning Africa Port) has been exploiting bauxite ore deposits on the Kaboyé plateau (Boké region) since July 2015. Despite its recent arrival, the exploitation and export of bauxite for the Chinese aluminum industry and market has already been problematic and the source of many dissatisfaction and socio-environmental problems. The transport of bauxite from the mines to the two river ports of Katougouma and Dapilon triggers the contamination of the fields, the water sources and the flora. The villages neighboring the mines, ports and the mining road denounce the air pollution caused by bauxite which endangers their health and their sources of subsistence. This is the case for instance, in the villages of Diakhabya (Dapilon) and Baniré (Dabis), where dust alters the leaves of cashew nuts, the cultivation of which was, up to that time, one of the main sources of subsistence. As a result of the reduction and pollution of water sources, agricultural activities have fallen considerably. The company proudly states it has compensated the populations for the fields taken away from them. Yet the villagers today complain that despite compensations the decline in land productivity puts their livelihood in jeopardy. The National Waterworks Development Service has dug a well in Djoumaya, where three out of six rivers have dried up. However, although drilling can mitigate social impacts, the drying up of rivers endangers animal species. To date, no concrete measures have been taken to mitigate air pollution. For its part, CMB-WPAis very eager to increase its capacities of extraction, transport and storage on the ports while it is not taking any responsibility for the pollution provoked. The riotsin the town of Boké in April and May 2017 occurred in a very tense social context. While bauxite has been exploited for decades in the Boké region, people do not benefit from the very lucrative economic activity on the world market. The recent arrival of the CMB-WPA consortium in the Boké region has not changed the situation for the inhabitants of Boké town. Thus, demonstrations burst in Boké town after repeated power cuts and a taxi driver was overturned and killed by a truck carrying bauxite. The main source of discontent remains the lack of employment for the local youth by the company CMB-WPA and by the other companies present in the region. For decades already Boké has been denouncing the air pollution caused by the transport of bauxite. Already in December 2016, the youths of Corrérah, a district in the town of Boké, demonstrated demanding to CMB-WPA the asphalting of the road between Corrérah and the city center. The neighborhood suffers from bauxite pollution caused by the consortium's trucks. Residents reported that their cashew trees had not produced anything in 2015, while the area's arable land was devastated. The young demonstrators only obtained the watering of the roadthree times a week from the company. They consider it insufficient in times of heat waves. In addition to not benefiting local populations while damaging their health, environment and sources of subsistence, CMB-WPA is contested by its employees who do not benefitdecent working conditions since the beginning (July 2015). Employees of the consortium and its subcontractors have repeatedly gone on strikes to try to make their claims heard. Between July 2016 and March 2016, in just eight months, the Katougouma workers went on strike 24 times. During the strike from 23 to 24 October 2015 the workers denounced the lack of health care and housing as well as the lack of safety and protection equipment necessary for all the workers. A new workers' strike in March 2016 was supported by the local populations who said they were ""disappointed by the non-payment of the royalties"". The workers demanded an equitable increase in their wages since the three companies of the consortium do not pay the same wages. These demands were not met since in June 2017 the employees of UMS again asked for an increase in their salaries to reach those of the employees of WAP."
